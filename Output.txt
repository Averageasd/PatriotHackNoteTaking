Output: 3-3 3.3 Current Flow in Semiconductors. Drift Current - Due to electric field Diffusion Current - Due to concentration gradient. Drift Current E Under the influence of an electric field holes and electrons + Holes Electrons are accelerated in opposite x directions and V Updrift = MpE Mp Hole mobility, Mp = 480 cm2/v.s for intrinsic Si V. n-drift = - MnE, / Mn = 1350 cm/V.S for intrinsic Si Explain why negative sign is there , see fig. above Hole Current Electron Current Ip = Aq b Vp-drift In = - Aqnv n-drift Ip = Aq p (MpE) In = - -Agn (-Mn E) Current density Jp In = In = gnME A Jp= Ip = qp Mp E A Total Current J= Jn+ Jp = q (PMp + num) E Also J=JE or J = E/S J - Conductively J= q (pMp + nMn) I Resistivity S = = I 9(pMp+nMn) S = E Units of S are s.cm 2cm = V/cm = V cm J A/cm2 A = rcm
