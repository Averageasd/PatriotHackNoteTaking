The text discusses the concept of Current Flow in Semiconductors, which is comprised of two types: drift current and diffusion current. Drift current, due to electric field, and diffusion current, due to concentration gradient, cause electrons and holes to move in opposite directions. The text notes hole mobility (Mp) for intrinsic Silicon as 480 cm2/V.S and Mn as 1350 cm2/V.S. The text also explains how to calculate the total current and introduces concepts of current density and resistivity. The units for resistivity are given as s.cm.
