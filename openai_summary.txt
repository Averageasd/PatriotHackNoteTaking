Title: A Brief History and Physical Structure of NMOS

I. Origin and Development of NMOS

   A) Birth of Solid-state Electric-field-controlled Conductor

    - Invented by Julius E. Lilienfeld, a physicist from University of Leipzig, in 1925.
    - Patent filed in Canada.
  
    B) Refinement and Expansion in the United States
    
    - Further patents were filed in the U.S. in 1926 and 1928.
    
    C) Heil's Contribution
    
    - In 1934, German physicist Oskar Heil filed a patent for a similar idea at the University of Cambridge.

    D) Obstacles and Delays
    
    - Development hindered as technology wasn't available.
    - Advent of bipolar transistors in 1947 overshadowed field-effect transistor development.
    
    E) William Shockley's Paper and Birth of MOSFET
    
    - Field-effect device described in a 1952 paper by William Shockley.
    - Patent for MOSFET filed in 1960 by Dawon Kahng and Martin Atalla at Bell Labs.

II. Modern Domination of NMOS

    - Key component of integrated-circuit chips.
    - Dominates the world of electronics with billions of MOS devices contained in today's chips.


III. Physical Structure of NMOS Transistor (Refer to Figure 5.1)

    A) Parts of NMOS Transistor 

    - Contains Source (S), Gate (G), Drain (D), and Body (B).

    B) Composition 

    - Consists of an Oxide (SiO2), Metal, and p-type substrate (Body). Channel region between n regions.

    C) Size specifications 

    - L ranges from 0.03 um to 1 um
    - W ranges from 0.05 um to 100 um
    - Thickness of oxide layer (tox) ranges from 1
