The paper discusses a fast implementation of a bilateral filter, an edge-preserving filtering technique that takes into account geometric closeness and photometric similarity of neighboring pixels. Bilateral filtering is computationally expensive due to the requirement to recompute the adaptive kernel at every pixel. This paper presents a separable version of a bilateral filter, which provides equivalent filtering capabilities but at a significantly reduced execution time. This makes it a suitable choice for fast pre-processing of images and videos. The research suggests better image quality and compression efficiency can be achieved if original videos are preprocessed using this separable bilateral filter.
