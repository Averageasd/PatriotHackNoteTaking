This text discusses the concept of current flow in semiconductors. It specifically explains two types of currents: Drift Current and Diffusion Current. The former is influenced by an electric field, and accelerates holes and electrons in opposite directions. The latter occurs due to a concentration gradient. The text also covers the concepts of mobility for both holes and electrons. Total current and current density are determined by these values. Additionally, the text brings up the concept of resistivity, explaining how it's calculated and its units.
