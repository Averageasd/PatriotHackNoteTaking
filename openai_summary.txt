✍️🎓 CURRENT FLOW IN SEMICONDUCTORS SUMMARY 📚💡

⚡🌀 SECTION 1: DRIFT CURRENT
➡️ Occurs due to the influence of an electric field
➡️ Involves holes and electrons accelerated in opposite directions
➡️ Factoid: Hole mobility (Mp) = 480 cm2/v.s for intrinsic Si

👆📊 Equations:
- V Updrift = MpE 
- V. n-drift = - MnE, / Mn = 1350 cm/V.S for intrinsic Si

🧐🔍Note: Negative sign is there to indicate opposite direction of flow

💫✨ SECTION 2: DIFFUSION CURRENT
➡️ Occurs due to concentration gradient

💫📊 Equations:
- Hole Current (Ip) = Aq p (MpE)
- Electron Current (In) = - Agn (-Mn E)

💥 SECTION 3: CURRENT DENSITY
➡️ Jp = Ip = qp Mp E A
➡️ In = In = gnME A

💥📊 Equations:
- Total Current J= Jn+ Jp = q (PMp + num) E
- Also J=JE or J = E/S
- Resistivity S = I 9(pMp+nMn)

📐⚙️ MECHANICS OF CURRENT
➡️ J - Conductivity J= q (pMp + nMn) 
➡️ Units of S are s.cm 2cm = V/cm = V cm J A/cm2 A = rcm
➡️Used to measure and understand the flow of current

👉👀 TL;DR: 🚀🗒️
The text discusses two types of current flow in semiconductors: drift and diffusion.
