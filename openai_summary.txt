The text discusses the current flow in semiconductors, specifically drift current and diffusion current. Drift current, caused by an electric field, pushes holes and electrons in opposite directions. Here, hole and electron mobility are provided for intrinsic silicon. The text also explains diffusion current, which happens due to concentration gradient and it discusses the associated equations. The total current is calculated by summing up the hole current and the electron current. Resistivity, represented as S, is given by the formula E/I, and its units are s.cm. The text concludes with derivations of current calculations where Mp, Mn and E are constants and p and n are the hole and electron concentrations respectively.
